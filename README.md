COMP576 Assignments
Assignment 1 & 2 for COMP576




Assignment 1: Building NN,focusing on foward and backpropagation and trying different activation function to observe accuracy.
              Using MNIST data set, try different activation function and steps, observe accuracy
              
Assignment 2: Train Cifar dataset. Tune parameters:
                                                    ntrain =  # per class
                                                    ntest =  # per class
                                                    nclass =  # number of classes
                                                    imsize = 28
                                                    nchannels = 1
                                                    batchsize = 50
             build fully connected NN. Observe accuracy and visualize accuracy and loss.
             visualize the first convolutional layer. Observe statistics of the layer
