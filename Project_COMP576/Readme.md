 generative adversarial network (GAN) is a innovated deep learning method, we are interested in if autoencoder can enchance the performance of GAN.
 The  Autoencoder_GAN_v2.ipynb are the codes for autoencoder-enchanced GAN
 The GAN_Random_Noise.ipynb are the codes for trying out adding random noises for better learning process to generate output image
